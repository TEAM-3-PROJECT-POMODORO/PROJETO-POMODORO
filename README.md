## Big Idea Concept

Time management and productivity in Swift programming

## Essential Question

How to implement the Pomodoro technique in Swift to improve efficiency in software development?

## Challenge

Develop a Swift application that implements the Pomodoro technique to help programmers manage their work and rest time.

## Guiding Questions

- What is the Pomodoro technique and what are its basic principles?
- What elements of the Swift language are necessary to implement a timer?
- How to structure the Swift code to alternate between work and rest periods?
- Which Swift libraries can be useful for notifications and user interface?

## Activities and Resources

- Research the Pomodoro technique and its variations
- Study the Swift Foundation library for time manipulation
- Explore creating simple user interfaces in Swift
- Implement a basic prototype of the Pomodoro timer

## Analysis and Reflection

When developing the Pomodoro app in Swift, consider:

- The effectiveness of the implementation compared to the original technique
- Challenges encountered in programming and how they were overcome
- Possible improvements and additional features for future versions

## Action

Create a functional Swift application that implements the Pomodoro technique, test it during programming sessions, and share the results with colleagues for feedback.
